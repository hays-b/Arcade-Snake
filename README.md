## How to Play 
- Control the snake by using either the arrow keys on your keyboard or the red buttons on the screen.
- If you score high enough, you can post it along with a 3 letter name for everyone to see.
- Or if you're not worried about highscores, you can play using your own custom settings by clicking the cog in the top right corner and adjusting the game to suit your preferences.
